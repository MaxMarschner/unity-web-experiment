# Unity for Behavioral Web Experiments 
This repository provides resources for building behavioral experiments with the Unity game engine and deploying them on a [Jatos](https://www.jatos.org/) server for online data collection.

## Background
For one of my PhD projects, I built a behavioral experiment in Unity to investigate behavioral effects of being imitated by other people. 
In the experiment, participants control an animated avatar hand and respond to visual stimuli with simple finger lift responses. 
The experiment assesses how imitative responses by other avatars in the virtual scene influence participants' response performance.

If you are interested in the theoretical background of this project and the findings of the experiment, here is a link to the [manuscript preprint](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/n4drs_v1). 

## What is in this repository and why should you care?
Unity is a great tool to build interactive virtual environments that can be used to simulate "naturalistic" social interactions while maintaining precise control over experimental variables.
As such, building behavioral experiments in Unity holds the potential to bridge the gap between careful laboratory control and "real-world" relevance of psychological experiments. 
Unfortunately, Unity was made for game developers, not for experimental psychologists, so setting up behavioral experiments in Unity is not straightforward. This repository showcases a working example of how to do so.
